Chenzo's Vagrant Take One
==========
*Just getting my Vagrant on.*

> You'll need to rename `config.yaml.bak` to `config.yaml` and then swap in your creditials in the config section - once that's done, you can `vagrant push` to a SFTP server of your choice. 

Built on a [Scotch Box](https://box.scotch.io/) for Digital Ocean deployment.

This also contains a *almost* totally blank PHP template with a gulp and sass for development.
